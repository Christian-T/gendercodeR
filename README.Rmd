# gendercodeR

The goal of gendercodeR is to allow simple recoding of freetext gender responses.

## Why would we do this?

Researchers who collect self-reported demographic data from respondents occasionally collect gender using a free-text response option. This has the advantage of respecting the gender diversity of respondents. However, this presents a challenge to researchers in that some inconsistencies in typography and spelling create a larger set of responses than would be required to fully capture the demographic characteristics of the sample. 

For example, male participants may provide freetext responses as "male", "man", "mail", "mael". Non-binary participants may provide responses as "nonbinary", "enby", "non-binary", "non binary"

This package uses dictionaries of common mispellings to recode these freetext responses into a consistent set of responses.

## Installation

This package is not on CRAN. To use this package please un the following code:


You can install the released version of gendercodeR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/gendercoder")
library(rmdrive)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
